# Perception Evaluator

A node for evaluating the output of perception systems.

## Purpose

This module allows for the evaluation of how accurately perception results are generated without the need for annotations. It is capable of confirming performance and can evaluate results from a few seconds prior, enabling online execution.

## Inner-workings / Algorithms

The evaluated metrics are as follows:

- predicted_path_deviation
- predicted_path_deviation_variance
- lateral_deviation
- yaw_deviation
- yaw_rate

### Predicted Path Deviation / Predicted Path Deviation Variance

Compare the predicted path of past objects with their actual traveled path to determine the deviation for **MOVING OBJECTS**. For each object, calculate the mean distance between the predicted path points and the corresponding points on the actual path, up to the specified time step. In other words, this calculates the Average Displacement Error (ADE). The target object to be evaluated is the object from $T_N$ seconds ago, where $T_N$ is the maximum value of the prediction time horizon $[T_1, T_2, ..., T_N]$.

> [!NOTE]
> The object from $T_N$ seconds ago is the target object for all metrics. This is to unify the time of the target object across metrics.

$$
\begin{align}
n_{points} = T / dt \\
ADE = \Sigma_{i=1}^{n_{points}} d_i / n_{points}ã€€\\
Var = \Sigma_{i=1}^{n_{points}} (d_i - ADE)^2 / n_{points}
\end{align}
$$

- $n_{points}$ : Number of points in the predicted path
- $T$ : Time horizon for prediction evaluation.
- $dt$ : Time interval of the predicted path
- $d_i$ : Distance between the predicted path and the actual traveled path at path point $i$
- $ADE$ : Mean deviation of the predicted path for the target object.
- $Var$ : Variance of the predicted path deviation for the target object.

The final predicted path deviation metrics are calculated by averaging the mean deviation of the predicted path for all objects of the same class, and then calculating the mean, maximum, and minimum values of the mean deviation.

$$
\begin{align}
ADE_{mean} = \Sigma_{j=1}^{n_{objects}} ADE_j / n_{objects} \\
ADE_{max} = max(ADE_j) \\
ADE_{min} = min(ADE_j)
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
Var_{mean} = \Sigma_{j=1}^{n_{objects}} Var_j / n_{objects} \\
Var_{max} = max(Var_j) \\
Var_{min} = min(Var_j)
\end{align}
$$

- $n_{objects}$ : Number of objects
- $ADE_{mean}$ : Mean deviation of the predicted path through all objects
- $ADE_{max}$ : Maximum deviation of the predicted path through all objects
- $ADE_{min}$ : Minimum deviation of the predicted path through all objects
- $Var_{mean}$ : Mean variance of the predicted path deviation through all objects
- $Var_{max}$ : Maximum variance of the predicted path deviation through all objects
- $Var_{min}$ : Minimum variance of the predicted path deviation through all objects

The actual metric name is determined by the object class and time horizon. For example, `predicted_path_deviation_variance_CAR_5.00`

### Lateral Deviation

Calculates lateral deviation between the smoothed traveled trajectory and the perceived position to evaluate the stability of lateral position recognition for **MOVING OBJECTS**. The smoothed traveled trajectory is calculated by applying a centered moving average filter whose window size is specified by the parameter `smoothing_window_size`. The lateral deviation is calculated by comparing the smoothed traveled trajectory with the perceived position of the past object whose timestamp is $T=T_n$ seconds ago. For stopped objects, the smoothed traveled trajectory is unstable, so this metric is not calculated.

### Yaw Deviation

Calculates the deviation between the recognized yaw angle of an past object and the yaw azimuth angle of the smoothed traveled trajectory for **MOVING OBJECTS**. The smoothed traveled trajectory is calculated by applying a centered moving average filter whose window size is specified by the parameter `smoothing_window_size`. The yaw deviation is calculated by comparing the yaw azimuth angle of smoothed traveled trajectory with the perceived orientation of the past object whose timestamp is $T=T_n$ seconds ago.
For stopped objects, the smoothed traveled trajectory is unstable, so this metric is not calculated.

### Yaw Rate

Calculates the yaw rate of an object based on the change in yaw angle from the previous time step. It is evaluated for **STATIONARY OBJECTS** and assesses the stability of yaw rate recognition. The yaw rate is calculated by comparing the yaw angle of the past object with the yaw angle of the object received in the previous cycle. Here, t2 is the timestamp that is $T_n$ seconds ago.

## Assumptions / Known limits

It is assumed that the current positions of PredictedObjects are reasonably accurate.

## Future extensions / Unimplemented parts

- Increase rate in recognition per class
- Metrics for objects with strange physical behavior (e.g., going through a fence)
- Metrics for splitting objects
- Metrics for problems with objects that are normally stationary but move
- Disappearing object metrics
